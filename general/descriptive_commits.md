When commiting code, ALWAYS use a descriptive message
------------

It doesn't matter how trivial the change you're pushing to your source control server, always leave a descriptive message:

* It will let others quickly now what was changed
* It helps with merge operations
* It will help you search the revision history in case you need to rollback to a previous version. 


Structure your commit message like this:
    
<pre>
Summarize clearly in one line what the commit is about

Describe the problem the commit solves or the use
case for a new feature. Justify why you chose
the particular solution.

Also, let everyone know if this change may introduce
side-effects to working code if that's the case.
</pre>
