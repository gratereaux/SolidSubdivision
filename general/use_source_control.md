Use Source Control. Even when programming solo.
------------

If you've ever worked with a team of two or more developers you would know that not using source control is a nightmare: The complexity or merging files grows exponentially as the number of people in the team increases. 

You should [**ALWAYS** use source control](http://whyshouldiuse.com/source-control), even if only working with yourself. Here's a couple of reasons:

* It's an undo mechanism
* It's a historical archive
* It's a reference point for diffs
* It's a backup of your code

And if you're working on a team it's even better:

* It helps isolate production-working code from development, reducing bugs on live sites/apps
* It helps branch new/risky/important changes to the codebase before pushing to production (see previous point)
* It allows more than one person to work on a file at the same time
* It allows a team lead to coordinate better
* It makes open-source possible :bowtie:

If you haven't used source control before, checkout some of the descriptions and tutorials below to get started:
