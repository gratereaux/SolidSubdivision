Learn how the HTTP Protocol works
------------

If you're a web developer you [should know this!!](http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/). 

Why should I? Let's quote [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000319.html) on this one:

> ...some of the biggest mistakes people make even at the highest architectural levels come from having a weak or broken understanding of a few simple things at the very lowest levels.

It's important to get to know the intricacies of the systems/frameworks/tools we use. If you're a .net or java developer, many of the working tidbits of the HTTP protocol are hidden behing IDE screens and wizards. 

If you're building Software as a Service for the web, there's a high chance that you will need to expose an API to let developers interact with your product/service. It's specifically important to get to know what [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) is, and the basic verbs used to consume URI's (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

You will also need some tools to make your REST/API development easier: If you're a Linux or OS X User, you've probably heard of [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/), if you program on a windows environment checkout [Fiddler](http://fiddler2.com/). You can also checkout the [Postman REST client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en), which runs on Google Chrome.
