Use explicit variable names
------------

Setting up variable names like 'i' or 'temp' is bad code. It hampers readability for other members of your programming team. 

Programming languages support long variable names. `activeCustomerName` will always be better than `custName`


This also applies to lists and iterators. It's easy to setup a loop like so:
    
    //javascript code
    for (var i=0; i<myList.length; i++){
        //Actions to take here
    }
    
But it's better to write it like this:

    //javascript code
    for (var myListIterator=0; myListIterator<myList.length; myListIterator++){
        //Actions to take here
    }

Why?

* If you want to search your code, you will have many `i` results
* In languages like javascript, that don't handle variable scoping this can also lead to errors
* If you find yourself trying to write many loops, you will lookup a better way to declare them. Languages like ruby provide many iterator functions that read better than for and while loops.
